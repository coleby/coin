# Coin

A quick and easy way to check cryptocurrency prices from mobile or desktop.

## Why?

This app was built so that myself or anyone really could check the current cryptocurrency pricing across multiple markets with a single page. I'm also doing this to have a solid way of learning React.js, so the app is meant to be resource-conservative, but it will be using React. Other than React, there will not be any CSS or styling in order to keep it light.
